# Dotfiles
Dotfiles is a collection of my personal configuration files.

### Install
Install the dotfiles using the installation script.

```
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

Each application has its own configuration directory that contains all of the
files, assets, etc. for that application.

```
dotfiles/
    neovim/
    tmux/
    zsh/
```
