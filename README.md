# Dotfiles
Dotfiles is a collection of my personal configuration files.

### Features
* [Neovim](vimo/README.md) - Neovim configuration files
* [Zsh](doc/README.md) - Zsh configuration for oh-my-zsh

### Install
Install the dotfiles using the installation script.

```
git clone git@gitlab.com:scott.bambrick/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

Each application has its own configuration directory that contains all of the
files, assets, etc. for that application.

```
dotfiles/
    neovim/            Configuration files for vim
    zsh/            oh-my-zsh configuration
```
